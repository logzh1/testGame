So this is how I did it:

1. Go to terminal and type in chmod +x "Downloaded Unity File Location here". You should see the icon of the file change.

2. Go to /Applications/Unity/Unity.app, and right click onto "Show Package Contents"

3. Go to Contents/MacOS and replace the old Unity file with the one you just downloaded.

4. Take your recently downloaded license file, Unity_v4.x.ulf, and replace it with the one in /Library/Application Support/Unity. If you don't have this folder, then make it.

5. Launch Unity, and it should work.
